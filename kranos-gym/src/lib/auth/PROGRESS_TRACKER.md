## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

### Architecture Decisions
1. **JWT over Sessions**: Chosen for scalability and stateless design
2. **Hardcoded Super User**: Simplified deployment, single point of control  
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Super User → Admin → Trainer → Member (future)
4. **7-Day Sessions**: Balance between security and user experience

### Technical Choices
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (consistent with existing codebase)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12+ salt rounds
- **Token Storage**: Secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Session Management**: JWT with refresh token rotation

### Future Considerations
- Multi-tenant architecture preparation
- Member role implementation
- Advanced reporting permissions
- API rate limiting for security
