## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in addressing the critical testing gaps. The payment and membership modules now have comprehensive test coverage, database transactions are thoroughly tested, and basic security measures are validated. The remaining gaps are primarily in authentication flows, API testing, and performance optimization, which represent a much smaller effort compared to what has been accomplished.

The test suite now provides strong confidence in the core business functions of the Kranos Gym Management System, with clear patterns established for completing the remaining test coverage.
