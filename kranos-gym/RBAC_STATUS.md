- **security_events**: Security incident logging

### Current User Accounts
- **Admin**: Prasanjit (username: pjb) - Full system access
- **Trainer**: Niranjan (username: niranjan) - View-only access
- **Members**: 71 accounts - One for each active gym member

## 2. Permission Categories ✅

```
Category        Permissions
--------        -----------
members         view, create, edit, delete, export
memberships     view, create, edit, delete, bulk_import
plans           view, create, edit, delete

  '/profile': ['profile.view'],
  '/settings': ['settings.view']
};
```

## Conclusion

The RBAC system in Kranos Gym Management System is **fully implemented and operational**. With 73 user accounts across three roles, comprehensive permissions, and enterprise-grade security features, the system is ready for production use. The identified security gaps are non-blocking but should be addressed in future updates for enhanced security.

### Quick Reference
- **Admin Login**: username: `pjb`, password: `admin123`
- **Trainer Login**: username: `niranjan`, password: `trainer123`
- **Member Login**: username: `[firstname+lastname]`, password: `member123`

All users should change their passwords after first login.
