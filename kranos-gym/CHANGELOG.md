## [2025-06-29] - Enterprise Authentication System Implementation

### Added
- **Complete Authentication System** with enterprise-grade security features:
  - JWT-based authentication with 1-hour access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
  - bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds and secure session management
  - Account lockout protection (5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout)
  - Comprehensive activity logging and security event tracking

- **User Management Interface** (`/users` route):
  - Full CRUD operations for user accounts with role-based permissions
  - Advanced search and filtering by username, email, status, and role
  - Admin password reset functionality with automatic session invalidation
  - Self-deletion prevention and comprehensive security logging

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Three-tier role hierarchy: Admin → Trainer → Member
  - 32 granular permissions across 6 categories (members, plans, memberships, reports, users, settings)
  - Route-level permission checking integrated in `hooks.server.js`
  - Dynamic navigation filtering based on user permissions

- **User Profile Management**:
  - Password change modal accessible from user dropdown menu
  - Current password verification with strong password validation
  - Automatic logout and session invalidation after password change
  - API endpoint: `/api/auth/change-password` for secure password updates

- **Database Schema Extensions**:
  - `users`, `user_sessions`, `permissions`, `role_permissions` tables
  - `user_activity_log` and `security_events` for comprehensive audit trails
  - Foreign key relationships and proper indexing for performance

### Enhanced
- **Navigation System** with permission-based menu filtering
- **Authentication Service** (`/src/lib/security/auth-service.js`) with comprehensive user management methods
- **Route Protection** with automatic redirects for unauthorized access attempts

### Fixed
- **Context7 Protocol Compliance** - Updated all authentication database operations to use Context7-grounded better-sqlite3 patterns:
  - Removed incorrect `async/await` usage from synchronous database operations
  - Implemented proper prepared statement caching and connection pooling
  - Fixed server action permission checks to use synchronous method calls

### Security
- **Password Security**: 8+ character minimum, bcrypt hashing, failed attempt tracking
- **Session Security**: httpOnly cookies, secure flags, automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Audit Trail**: All user operations logged with metadata, IP addresses, and severity levels
- **Permission Enforcement**: Granular permissions checked at route and API level

## [2025-06-28] - Reporting System Enhancement
### Fixed
- **Upcoming Renewals Display Issue** - Fixed "No memberships expiring in the next 30 days!" showing when renewals exist
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend making failed API calls to non-existent endpoints and overriding server data
  - **Solution**: Created missing API endpoints and updated frontend component data flow

### Added
- **Reports API Endpoints** with proper database connection patterns:
  - `/api/reports/renewals` - Returns upcoming membership renewals (configurable days parameter)  
  - `/api/reports/financial` - Returns comprehensive financial data with revenue breakdowns
- **Enhanced Frontend Integration**:
  - Added `export let data` prop to receive server-loaded data
  - Updated API response handling for `{ success: boolean, data: array }` format
  - Maintained both server-side rendering AND dynamic API loading capability

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Verification**: Confirmed 3 upcoming renewals exist (Chiranjiv, Bala, Ram)
- **API Response Structure**: Standardized success/data format across both endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with console logging and proper HTTP status codes
- **Query Optimization**: Renewals endpoint supports configurable timeframe via query parameters

### Result
- "Upcoming Renewals" section now displays actual 3 renewal records instead of empty state
- Both server-side data loading and dynamic API updates working as intended
- Consistent API response format established for future reporting endpoints

## [2024-06-27] - CSV Bulk Import System
### Added
- **Complete CSV Bulk Import System** for group class memberships
  - New route: `/memberships/bulk-import` with 4-step workflow
  - CSV template download with required headers
  - File upload with real-time validation and error highlighting
  - Editable data table for correcting invalid entries
  - Import preview showing summary of data to be created
  - Navigation integration from memberships page (Group Class only)

### Implementation Details
- **Files Added:**
  - `/src/lib/db/import-csv.js` - Standalone CSV import script
  - `/src/routes/memberships/bulk-import/+page.server.js` - Server actions
  - `/src/routes/memberships/bulk-import/+page.svelte` - UI component
  - `BULK_IMPORT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation documentation

- **Files Modified:**

- Duplicate prevention through database constraints

### Testing Status

- Real-time validation with editable table interface
- Secure file upload with 1MB size limit and CSV-only restriction
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout workflow
- Fixed SQL quotes issue in import script (double → single quotes)
