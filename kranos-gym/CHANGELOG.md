# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kranos Gym Management System will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2025-06-28] - Reporting System Enhancement
### Fixed
- **Upcoming Renewals Display Issue** - Fixed "No memberships expiring in the next 30 days!" showing when renewals exist
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend making failed API calls to non-existent endpoints and overriding server data
  - **Solution**: Created missing API endpoints and updated frontend component data flow

### Added
- **Reports API Endpoints** with proper database connection patterns:
  - `/api/reports/renewals` - Returns upcoming membership renewals (configurable days parameter)  
  - `/api/reports/financial` - Returns comprehensive financial data with revenue breakdowns
- **Enhanced Frontend Integration**:
  - Added `export let data` prop to receive server-loaded data
  - Updated API response handling for `{ success: boolean, data: array }` format
  - Maintained both server-side rendering AND dynamic API loading capability

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Verification**: Confirmed 3 upcoming renewals exist (Chiranjiv, Bala, Ram)
- **API Response Structure**: Standardized success/data format across both endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with console logging and proper HTTP status codes
- **Query Optimization**: Renewals endpoint supports configurable timeframe via query parameters

### Result
- "Upcoming Renewals" section now displays actual 3 renewal records instead of empty state
- Both server-side data loading and dynamic API updates working as intended
- Consistent API response format established for future reporting endpoints

## [2024-06-27] - CSV Bulk Import System
### Added
- **Complete CSV Bulk Import System** for group class memberships
  - New route: `/memberships/bulk-import` with 4-step workflow
  - CSV template download with required headers
  - File upload with real-time validation and error highlighting
  - Editable data table for correcting invalid entries
  - Import preview showing summary of data to be created
  - Navigation integration from memberships page (Group Class only)

### Implementation Details
- **Files Added:**
  - `/src/lib/db/import-csv.js` - Standalone CSV import script
  - `/src/routes/memberships/bulk-import/+page.server.js` - Server actions
  - `/src/routes/memberships/bulk-import/+page.svelte` - UI component
  - `BULK_IMPORT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation documentation

- **Files Modified:**
  - `/src/routes/memberships/+page.svelte` - Added bulk import navigation
  - `/src/lib/db/database.js` - Added `getGroupPlanByNameAndDuration()` method

### Business Logic Features
- Auto-creates members (if phone doesn't exist) and plans (if name+duration combo doesn't exist)
- Sets plan default_amount from first occurrence in CSV
- Auto-calculates membership end dates and determines New/Renewal types
- Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- Duplicate prevention through database constraints

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Fully Tested**: Successfully imported 5 test memberships
- ✅ **Data Verified**: Proper member/plan/membership relationships created
- ✅ **Build Verified**: Project builds without critical errors
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: All files reflect current implementation

### Technical Implementation
- CSV format: `name,phone,email,plan_name,duration_days,start_date,amount_paid,purchase_date`
- Real-time validation with editable table interface
- Secure file upload with 1MB size limit and CSV-only restriction
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout workflow
- Fixed SQL quotes issue in import script (double → single quotes)
